## My process

Used Grid to layout the cards then flex-box to layout elements inside the card. The intent of this challenege for me was to practice grid. Having trouble trying to make it more responsive as you drag open a browser window from small to full screen. Any advice is appreciated.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom 
- CSS Grid: to organize testimonial cards
- Flexbox: to organize elements inside cards
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


### Continued development

Need to continue practicing with grid.
